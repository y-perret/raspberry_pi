# Raspberry Pi Personal Project

This is a personal project I worked on during my free time. The idea was to explore possible applications for the Raspberry Pi 4 computer I bought.
The goal of the project is to extend my knowledge in different fields related to the PI (linux, hardware, I/O, image processing,...)

## Material

The material used in this project is:

* Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)
* The Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2
* [Pan/Tilt Bracket Kit (Single Attachment)](https://www.pi-shop.ch/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/650x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/1/4/14391-01a.jpg)

## TODO list

Some possible features I plan to add:

* Control of the servos with pan/tilt
* Control of camera
* Web interface to control the camera
* Face recognition 
* Control using a controller
